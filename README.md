# Next.js 9 Start Kit, The React SSR Framework


## Features

<dl>
  <dt>Quick scaffolding</dt>
  <dd>Create components, containers, routes, selectors and sagas - and their tests - right from the CLI!</dd>

  <dt>Instant feedback</dt>
  <dd>Enjoy the best DX (Developer eXperience) and code your app at the speed of thought! Your saved changes to the CSS and JS are reflected instantaneously without refreshing the page. Preserve application state even when you update something in the underlying code!</dd>

  <dt>Predictable state management</dt>
  <dd>Unidirectional data flow allows for change logging and time travel debugging.</dd>

  <dt>Next generation JavaScript</dt>
  <dd>Use template strings, object destructuring, arrow functions, JSX syntax and more.</dd>

  <dt>Next generation CSS</dt>
  <dd>Write composable CSS that's co-located with your components for complete modularity. Unique generated class names keep the specificity low while eliminating style clashes. Ship only the styles that are on the page for the best performance.</dd>

  <dt>Industry-standard routing</dt>
  <dd>It's natural to want to add pages (e.g. `/about`) to your application, and routing makes this possible.</dd>

  <dt>Industry-standard i18n internationalization support</dt>
  <dd>Scalable apps need to support multiple languages, easily add and support multiple languages with `react-intl`.</dd>

  <dt>Offline-first</dt>
  <dd>The next frontier in performant web apps: availability without a network connection from the instant your users load the app.</dd>

  <dt>Static code analysis</dt>
  <dd>Focus on writing new features without worrying about formatting or code quality. With the right editor setup, your code will automatically be formatted and linted as you work.</dd>

  <dt>SEO</dt>
  <dd>We support SEO (document head tags management) for search engines that support indexing of JavaScript content. (eg. Google)</dd>

## How to use

https://nextjs.org/docs

## Using `WebStorm`

1. `.next` folder search file index is slow,
so you can set `.next` folder `mark directory as` / `excluded`

1. `src/pages` folder is Link Root Path
so you can set `src/pages` folder `mark directory as` / `Resource Root`

2. Javascript language version set `Flow`
   > [Preferences / Languages & Frameworks / javascript language version](https://blog.jetbrains.com/webstorm/2016/11/using-flow-in-webstorm/)
   Flow package or exectable set {your path}/node_modules/flow-bin

3. Install plugin [Styled Components & Styled JSX](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9997-styled-components--styled-jsx/)

### Using `create-next-app`

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/segmentio/create-next-app) with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/) or [npx](https://github.com/zkat/npx#readme) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example custom-server-express custom-server-express-app
# or
yarn create next-app --example custom-server-express custom-server-express-app
```

### Download manually

Download the example:

```bash
curl https://codeload.github.com/zeit/next.js/tar.gz/canary | tar -xz --strip=2 next.js-canary/examples/custom-server-express
cd custom-server-express
```

Install it and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn
yarn dev
```

Deploy it to the cloud with [now](https://zeit.co/now) ([download](https://zeit.co/download))

```bash

## The idea behind the example

Most of the times the default Next server will be enough but sometimes you want to run your own server to customize routes or other kind of the app behavior. Next provides a [Custom server and routing](https://github.com/zeit/next.js#custom-server-and-routing) so you can customize as much as you want.

Because the Next.js server is just a node.js module you can combine it with any other part of the node.js ecosystem. in this case we are using express to build a custom router on top of Next.

The example shows a server that serves the component living in `pages/a.js` when the route `/b` is requested and `pages/b.js` when the route `/a` is accessed. This is obviously a non-standard routing strategy. You can see how this custom routing is being made inside `server.js`.
