/**
 * HOC for adding dynamic reducers to the global store.
 *
 * Typical usage:
 *   export default withReducer('myComponent', reducer)(MyComponent)
 *
 * Thoughts:
 *   This uses Context which has all of the warnings in the React
 *   docs to not use, but it's still documented and works here.
 *   If context seems like a bad idea, I *think* you could instead
 *   use react-redux.connect here instead. Once connected, this
 *   HOC would have access to store as a prop. Once you have
 *   access to store, you have access to injectReducer. That's the
 *   main goal, get access to the store object.
